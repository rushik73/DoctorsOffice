 Summary of the Doctor's Office Simulation Project
The Doctor's Office Simulation project, as part of the Operating Systems course, offered a challenge that combined concepts of concurrency and synchronization with practical application of a clinic. The goal was to simulate a visit to a doctor's office using Java threads and semaphores, focusing on the coordination of multiple threads representing patients, doctors, nurses, and a receptionist. The simulation was designed to mimic the real-world flow of a clinic, where patients arrive, register with a receptionist, wait in a waiting room, see a nurse, consult with a doctor, and finally leave the clinic. This process involved managing concurrency to ensure that the clinic operates smoothly and efficiently without deadlocks or race conditions. Each entity in the clinic (patients, doctors, nurses, receptionist) was represented by a separate thread, and their interactions were managed using semaphores.
One of the primary challenges was ensuring that all threads operated without stepping on each deadlock and race conditions. Initially, managing the synchronization between the receptionist and patients was tricky, as it was essential to make sure patients did not proceed without registering. Similarly, coordinating the nurses and doctors to ensure that a patient was seen by a doctor in an order presented some problems. Achieving minimal wait times and avoiding deadlock situations required adjustment of the semaphores. Another difficulty was in simulating the dynamic and unpredictable nature of a clinic's workflow, such as varying consultation times and the arrival of patients. Implementing randomness in patient arrival and doctor consultation times helped in creating a more realistic simulation but also introduced variability that needed to be managed to maintain synchronization.
This project was an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge from the course to a practical problem. It helped me with the understanding of threads and semaphores, especially the significance of semaphore initialization and the impact of acquire and release operations on thread synchronization. It also highlighted the importance of designing a system with concurrency in mind from the beginning and properly separating concerns among the different entities and defining clear interfaces for interaction between them proved vital for the simulation's success.
The simulation was successful in replicating the workflow of a doctor's office, demonstrating how multiple threads can work together synchronously to achieve a common goal. The output closely matched the expected results, with patients being registered, seen by doctors, and leaving the clinic in an orderly fashion. The system was able to handle the specified number of patients and doctors without encountering deadlocks or other synchronization issues.
